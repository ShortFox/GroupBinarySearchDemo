# GroupBinarySearchDemo
Group Binary Search Task (Roberts &amp; Goldstone, 2011) demo implemented in Unity using PUN

## Game Objective

You and your friends must work together to guess how many fingers a computer is pointing behind their back!

## Game Rules

Each round, each teammember can guess a number between 0 to 50 (inclusive).

The computer can point anywhere between 51 to 100 fingers (inclusive).

If the sum of a team's guesses equal the number of fingers the computer is pointing, your team wins! Otherwise, try another guess!

If you select a number above 50, your guess will default to 0.

If your team is at least 15 members, the computer picks a number between 101-200!
